                            Swayambhu (Devanagari: स्वयम्भू स्तूप; Nepal Bhasa: स्वयंभू; sometimes Swayambu or Swoyambhu)
                             is an ancient religious architecture atop a hill in the Kathmandu Valley, west of Kathmandu city.
                             The Tibetan name for the site means 'Sublime Trees' (Wylie: Phags.pa Shing.kun), for the many
                             varieties of trees found on the hill. However, Shing.kun may be a corruption of the local Nepal
                             Bhasa name for the complex, Swayambhu, meaning 'self-sprung'.[1] For the Buddhist Newars,
                             in whose mythological history and origin myth as well as day-to-day religious practice Swayambhunath 
                             occupies a central position, it is probably the most sacred among
                             Buddhist pilgrimage sites. For Tibetans and followers of Tibetan Buddhism,
                             it is second only to Boudha.

                    <p>
                            The Pashupatinath Temple (Nepali: पशुपतिनाथ मन्दिर) is a famous and sacred Hindu temple 
                            complex that is located on the banks of the Bagmati River, 
                            approximately 5 km north-east of Kathmandu in the eastern part of Kathmandu Valley,
                            the capital of Nepal. The temple serves as the seat of Pashupatinath.
                            This temple complex was inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage Sites's list in 1979.
                            This "extensive Hindu temple precinct" is a "sprawling collection of temples, ashrams, 
                            images and inscriptions raised over the centuries along the banks of the sacred Bagmati river" 
                            and is included as one of the seven monument groups in UNESCO's designation of Kathmandu Valley as visit here.
                            The temple is one of the 275 Tamil Paadal Petra Sthalams (Holy Abodes of Shiva) on the continent.
                            Kotirudra Samhita, Chapter 11 on the Shivalingas of the North, in Shiva Purana mentions this Shivalinga 
                            as the bestower of all wishes.

                    Mount Everest (Nepali: Sagarmatha सगरमाथा; Tibetan: Chomolungma ཇོ་མོ་གླང་མ; Chinese: Zhumulangma 珠穆朗玛) is
                    Earth's highest mountain above sea level, located in the Mahalangur Himal sub-range
                    of the Himalayas. The international border between Nepal (Province No. 1) and China
                    (Tibet Autonomous Region) runs across its summit point.
                    The current official elevation of 8,848 m (29,029 ft), recognised by China and Nepal, 
                    was established by a 1955 Indian survey and subsequently confirmed by a Chinese survey 
                    in 1975.
                    In 1865, Everest was given its official English name by the Royal Geographical Society,
                    as recommended by Andrew Waugh, the British Surveyor General of India, who chose the name of 
                    his predecessor in the post, Sir George Everest, despite Everest's objections.[6]

                            Pokhara (Nepali: पोखरा) is a metropolitan city in Nepal, 
                            which serves as the capital of Gandaki Pradesh. It is the country's second largest city 
                            in terms of population and the largest in terms of area. The city also serves as the
                            headquarters of Kaski District. Pokhara is located 200 kilometres (120 miles) west of the capital, 
                            Kathmandu. The altitude varies from 827 metres (2,713 feet) in the southern part to 1,740 metres 
                            (5,710 feet) in the north. The Annapurna Range, with three out of the ten highest mountains in the world
                            — Dhaulagiri, Annapurna I and Manaslu — is within 15–35 mi (24–56 km) of the valley.
                            Pokhara is considered the tourism capital of Nepal, being a base for trekkers
                             undertaking the Annapurna Circuit through the Annapurna Conservation Area region 
                             of the Annapurna ranges in the Himalayas. The city is also home to many of the elite 
                             Gurkha soldiers.
